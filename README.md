# WOWS Karma
### The Persistent and Comprehensive Karma system for World of Warships. <br />([wows-karma.com](https://wows-karma.com))

**WOWS Karma is a reputation system for Wargaming's hit game World of Warships.** <br />
Based on player-driven content, WOWS Karma allows players to send Posts to rate their interactions with other Players.
These in turn fuels the platform, that provides metrics, to further evaluate with precision a player's Karma.

Furthermore, as we believe in full transparency, all our platform metrics emanate from visible and public posts.
This, coupled with the fact that anonymity is not a possibility, makes this platform a tracable therefore more stable and precise Karma system than provided in-game.

### Karma can go Negative here.
Allowing the karma to go negative gives us a more extended metric, that can help distinguish the more troublesome elements of the community.  
This is in clear contrast to the in-game Karma, whose minimum cap is flatting out at 0. 
While also a protection for a more volatile metric, it provides no distiction for real problems, which in contrast, is possible on our platform.

### Support for Replays
**With recently added Replay analysis, we are providing a source of thruth to every post.** <br />
As all posts are made public, any user can evaluate a player's claim, by reviewing the post's attached replay.

### WoWs Monitor support
Our platform is used extensively by the popular statistics tool named **[WoWs Monitor](https://wows-monitor.com/)**.  
This allows prime readount of our metrics exactly where you need it: In battle. 
Our metrics are read out in real-time by the WoWs Monitor and merged with in-game metrics.
Interacting with a player can be hazardous, may it be with words, or with guns. Which is why you'll be able to second-opinion a player's standing using our metrics, in battle.

Furthermore, WOWS Karma's integration in the WoWs Monitor allows you to link directly to players, to streamline your interactions with the platform. 
Clicking on a player on the Monitor will open up his profile on WOWS Karma. Easy as that!
