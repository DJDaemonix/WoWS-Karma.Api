				<strong class="mr-3">1.</strong>
				No excessive toxicity
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				We understand people may get heated in the middle of a game,
				but try to maintain a respectful, factual account of what happened when posting.
				Please avoid personal attacks, name-calling, hate-speech, cursing, or low effort insults in posts.

				No shitposting/low-effort posts
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				When writing a post, it is helpful to everyone to include WHY the player is good/bad.

				Do not just say <i>“He’s good”</i>,
				but say <i>“He’s good because he spotted the DD, he dropped fighters, he capped, etc”</i>.
				Do not just say <i>“He sucks,”</i>,
				but say <i>“He TKed our Shima and then he cursed at us in chat for not doing what he wanted.”</i>
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				<ul>
					<li>
						This also applies to posts that only compliment/criticize a player’s position on the scoreboard
						or the amount of xp he/she earned.
					</li>

					<li>
						Submitting posts that are duplicates of another post is considered plagiarism and low-effort.
						This includes copying your own posts.
					</li>

					<li>
						Off-topic posts that don't relate the player's performance, teamplay, or courtesy
						are considered low-effort.
					</li>
				</ul>

				No criticism of player stats.
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Following Wargaming’s policy on statshaming, any comments relating to player stats,
				outside of ship analytical purposes, are forbidden on this platform.
				Statistics or hidden statistics are accessible through wows-numbers.com for everyone to see,
				and as such, are not a necessary component of a post.
				As a transient metric, statistics do not reflect a player’s potential.
				It should focus on what they can be, not what they are now.
				<br /><br />
				This includes: <br />

				<ul>
					<li>Criticizing one’s win-rate. There is no exception.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s PR when irrelevant or without context.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s no. of battles or choice of ship when irrelevant or without context.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s hidden stats when irrelevant or without context.</li>
				</ul>

				No Sock-puppeting (Use your own account)
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Do not use an alt account to post on other people’s pages.
				Patterns of abuse of this rule are subject to sitewide ban.

				No statistical fraud
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				For example: <br />
				If your posting account has no games past T4,
				yet you’re saying that someone <i>“drove their Yamato straight into the cap and died”</i>,
				it is clear you weren’t in game with them, and/or you’re not using your own account. <br />

				Use the Post Flairs properly
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Performance, Teamplay and Courtesy flairs exist for a reason. <br />
				If someone is a bad player but says nothing in chat,
				don’t click negative for Courtesy, just do so for Gameplay.
				This is important to create depth and value in ratings.

				Provide valid evidence
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				We cannot force everyone to upload evidence,
				but not uploading evidence may discredit your post and lead to post deletion.
				There is no proper way to upload evidence, like screenshots and replays, directly to the site,
				but please try to upload them to another website and then post the link(s) in your posts.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Sites such as <a href="https://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">Imgur</a>
				and <a href="https://replayswows.com/" target="_blank">WoWS Replays</a>
				can be used to upload evidence. <br />

				To shorten your links to usable sizes, you can use
				<a href="https://cutter.nodsoft.net/" target="_blank">NSYS Cutter</a>.

				Post in English if possible
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				To make the moderator’s job easier, we encourage you to post in English.
				We will try to understand posts in other languages to the best of our abilities
				and do have moderators that speak other languages,
				but translating posts may lead to misunderstanding and subsequent post edits or deletion.
