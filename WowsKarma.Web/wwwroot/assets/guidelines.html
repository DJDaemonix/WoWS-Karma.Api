	<ol id="post" class="list-group">
		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-1">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">1.</strong>
				No excessive toxicity
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				We understand people may get heated in the middle of a game, 
				but try to maintain a respectful, factual account of what happened when posting. <br />
				Please avoid cursing or low effort insults in posts.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-2">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">2.</strong>
				No shitposting/low-effort posts
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				When writing a post, it is helpful to everyone to include WHY the player is good/bad.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Do not just say <i>“He’s good”</i>, 
						but say <i>“He’s good because he spotted the DD, he dropped fighters, he capped, etc”</i>.
					</li>

					<li>
						Do not just say <i>“He sucks”</i>, 
						but say <i>“He TKed our Shima and then he cursed at us in chat for not doing what he wanted”</i>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				<ul>
					<li>This also applies to posts that only compliment/criticize a player’s position on the scoreboard or the amount of xp he/she earned.</li>
					<li>Submitting posts that are duplicates of another post is considered plagiarism and low-effort. <br />This includes copying your own posts.</li>
					<li>Off-topic posts that don't relate the player's performance, teamplay, or courtesy are also considered low-effort.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-3">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">3.</strong>
				No criticism of player stats.
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Following Wargaming’s policy on statshaming, any comments relating to player stats, 
				outside of ship analytical purposes, are forbidden on this platform.
				<br />
				As a transient metric, statistics do not reflect a player’s potential. 
				It should focus on what they can be, not what they are now.
			</p>

		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-4">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">4.</strong>
				No Sock-puppeting (Use your own account)
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Do not use an alt account to post on other people’s pages. 
				Patterns of abuse of this rule are subject to sitewide ban.
			</p>
		</li>



		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-5">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">5.</strong>
				No statistical perjury
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				For example: <br />
				If your posting account has no games past T4, 
				yet you’re saying that someone <i>“drove their Yamato straight into the cap and died”</i>, 
				it is clear you weren’t in game with them, and/or you’re not using your own account.  <br />

		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-6">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">6.</strong>
				Use the Post Flairs properly
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Performance, Teamplay and Courtesy flairs exist for a reason. <br />
				If someone is a bad player but says nothing in chat, 
				don’t click negative for Courtesy, just do so for Gameplay.  
				This is important to create depth and value in ratings.
			</p>
		</li>

		<li class="list-group-item p-4" id="post-7">
			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">
				<strong class="mr-3">7.</strong>
				Provide valid evidence
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				There is no proper way to upload evidence, like screenshots and replays, directly to the site, 
				but please try to upload them to another website and then post the link(s) in your posts. 
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Sites such as <a href="https://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">Imgur</a> 
				and <a href="https://replayswows.com/" target="_blank">WoWS Replays</a> 
				can be used to upload evidence. <br />

				To shorten your links to usable sizes, you can use 
				<a href="https://cutter.nodsoft.net/" target="_blank">NSYS Cutter</a>.
