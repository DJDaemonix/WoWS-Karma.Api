				No shitposting/low-effort posts
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				When writing a post, it is helpful to everyone to include WHY the player is good/bad.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Do not just say <i class="text-danger">“He’s good”</i>, but say
				<i class="text-success">“He’s good because he spotted the DD, he dropped fighters, he capped, etc”</i>. <br />
				Do not just say <i class="text-danger">“He sucks”</i>, but say
				<i class="text-success">“He TKed our Shima and then he cursed at us in chat for not doing what he wanted”</i>. <br />
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Post content usually includes battle details and details about player decisions,
				but may also include player behavior outside of battle.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				<ul>
					<li>
						This also applies to posts that only compliment/criticize a player’s position on the scoreboard
						or the amount of xp he/she earned.
					</li>

					<li>
						Submitting posts that are duplicates of another post without sufficient reasoning,
						such as players being in a division, is considered plagiarism and low-effort.
						This includes copying your own posts.
					</li>

					<li>
						Off-topic posts that don't relate to the player's performance, teamplay, or courtesy
						are considered low-effort.
					</li>

					<li>
						Please provide sufficient reasoning or evidence if accusing someone of being a bot,
						buying/using another account, cheating, or any other severe infringement to Wargaming's TOS.
					</li>

				No criticism of player stats.
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Following Wargaming’s policy on statshaming, any comments relating to player stats,
				outside of ship analytical purposes, are forbidden on this platform.
				Statistics or hidden statistics are accessible through
				<a href="https://wows-numbers.com/" target="_blank">WOWS Numbers</a> for everyone to see,
				and as such, are not a necessary component of a post.
				As a transient metric, statistics do not reflect a player’s potential.
				It should focus on what they can be, not what they are now.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				This non-exhaustively includes:

				<ul>
					<li>Criticizing one’s win-rate. There is no exception.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s PR when irrelevant or without context.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s no. of battles or choice of ship when irrelevant or without context.</li>
					<li>Criticizing one’s hidden stats when irrelevant or without context.</li>

				No Sock-puppeting (Use your own account)

			<p class="card-text">
				Do not use an alt account to post on other people’s pages.
				Patterns of abuse of this rule are subject to sitewide ban.

				No statistical fraud
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				For example: <br />
				If your posting account has no games past T4,
				yet you’re saying that someone <i>“drove their Yamato straight into the cap and died”</i>,
				it is clear you weren’t in game with them, and/or you’re not using your own account. <br />

				Use the Post Flairs properly
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				Performance, Teamplay and Courtesy flairs exist for a reason. <br />
				If someone is a bad player but says nothing in chat,
				don’t click negative for Courtesy, just do so for Gameplay.
				This is important to create depth and value in ratings.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text text-muted">
				Strictly-Neutral posts are considered to be informative,
				and thus do not necessarily need to be related
				to the player’s performance, teamplay, or courtesy.

			<h3 class="list-group-item-heading">

				Provide valid evidence
			</h3>

			<p class="card-text">
				All posts require that the poster upload evidence in the form of replays or relevant screenshots/videos.
				Please use the built-in replay upload function to upload a relevant replay.
				This is to confirm that the poster has been in the battle
				with the player being written about and to confirm chat logs.
				Posts that describe the player’s in-game gameplay, teamplay, or courtesy requires evidence.
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Some exceptions to be noted:

				<ul>
					<li>Posts that describe the player’s courtesy outside of the game do not require replay evidence.</li>
					<li>Neutral posts that neither compliment nor report a player.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p class="card-text">
				Sites such as <a href="https://imgur.com/upload" target="_blank">Imgur</a>
				can be used to upload graphical evidence, should replay evidence not be applicable.
